              <p>Structuring a webpage has always been an essential part of web development. HTML stands for the hypertext markup
                language, and it is the standard markup language for creating structured web pages. HTML5 is the fifth rendition of HTML
                and introduces new elements that are even more important for structuring and presenting the contents of a webpage.</p>
                <p>An HTML document is nothing without the elements that tell our browser what we want to display. One of the most critical
                elements is the div element which acts as a container by helping group elementsâ€”enclosing other tags is a great way to
                structure a web page layout.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The div container helps with the look of a website structure, but that's all it can do. For example, a div element
                    may
                    look nice in the output window but fails at informing the browser of its purpose. The div element is also known as a
                    general container element.</li>
                  <li>Generic div containers bring challenges for people relying on screen reader software. For example, if the browser
                    can't
                    make out the tags used on a website, then some information about the contents found on a webpage is left unspoken. A
                    problem that leads visually impaired people to become very frustrated with a sense of feeling left out.</li>
